    <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works. You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.</p>
    <p>The backend is the server side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client side of the website works fine. It is part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.</p>
